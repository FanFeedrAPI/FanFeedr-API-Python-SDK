have access to two pieces of data:


1. Your API key
2. The name of the tier you are signed up (basic, bronze, silver, gold)


Installation
----------

Installation is run through setuptools and setup.py.  To install this module simply run
the command:

python setup.py install

in the base directory

How to use
----------

Here are a few easy to use use cases for how to use the FanFeedr API Python SDK


First, to get detailed information for all teams in the MLB.

------
from fanfeedr import FanFeedrAPI


ffapi = FanFeedrAPI("your-key", tier="your-tier") #Default basic.
leagues = ffapi.get_collection("leagues")
mlb = None
for league in leagues:
    if league["name"] == "MLB":
        mlb = league
        break
conferences = ffapi.get_collection("conferences", ptype="leagues", puid=mlb["id"])
lmerge = lambda x, y: x+y
divisions = reduce(lmerge, [ffapi.get_collection("divisions",
       ptype="conferences",
       puid=conference["id"]) for conference in conferences])
teams = reduce(lmerge, [ffapi.get_collection("teams", ptype="divisions", puid=division["id"])
     for division in divisions])
teams = map(lambda x: ffapi.get_resource("teams", x["id"]), teams)
print teams
-------

Second, get the hottest news for the Red Sox (using the team data from above)

-----
from fanfeedr import FanFeedrAPI
red_sox = None
for team in teams:
    if team["name"] == "Boston Red Sox":
        red_sox = team
        break
articles = sorted(ffapi.get_collection("content", ptype="teams", puid=red_sox["id"]),
                  key=lambda x: x["hotness"],
                  reverse=True)
#Get full info for top 10
articles = [ffapi.get_resource("content", article["id"]) for article in articles[:10]]
print articles
-----

Last, get the next games (in two weeks) for the Red Sox (using the team data from the first example

-----


from fanfeedr import FanFeedrAPI
ffapi = FanFeedrAPI("your-key", tier="your-tier")
red_sox = None
for team in teams:
    if team["name"] == "Boston Red Sox":
        red_sox = team
        break
events = ffapi.get_collection_method("next", "events", ptype="teams", puid=red_sox["id"])
events = [ffapi.get_resource("events", event["id"]) for event in events]
print events
